#' getFlightTracker
#' 
#' A function to get information about all flights in the world with 
#' 
#' \strong{Flight Tracker API}
#' Clients can connect to the flight tracking through the API key which gives 
#' direct access to all the live flight data. The flight tracker API allows 
#' clients to display within their applications or on their websites and other 
#' platforms, the actual tracking of flights including all their relevant 
#' information. This service is central to our aviation data and maintained
#' constantly within our database. Since the data is live, the updates happen 
#' within short intervals of just a few minutes. Aviation Edgeâ€™s function is 
#' to gather and maintain the complete aviation data for our clients so that 
#' they can create the functional tools for their customers.
#'  
#' \strong{Sources and process}
#' The data of the flight tracking API is collected through ADS-B systems as
#' well as the use of flight schedules to anticipate the location and fill in
#' the gaps where needed. We also receive data from our aviation partners and 
#' combine all this to the central system for our clients.
#' 
#' \strong{Data included in the Flight Tracker API}
#' Geography: Location information such as latitude, longitude, altitude and direction.
#' Speed: Vertical and horizontal speed of aircraft.
#' Departure and arrival: IATA codes and ICAO codes of the departure and arrival location.
#' Aircraft and flight: IATA and ICAO number of flight and registration number, ICAO code and ICAO24 code of aircraft.
#' Airline: IATA code and ICAO code of airline.
#' System information: Squawk, status and last updated.
