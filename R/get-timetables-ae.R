#' getTimetablesAE
#' 
#' A function to get timetables of all flights departing or arrivingin a
#' specific airport.
#' 
#' \strong{Flight schedules and Timetables API}
#' The API service provides the flight schedules and timetables of all airports 
#' and airlines around the world and maintains this for the clients in a central
#' database, always accessible with the personal API key. The airport and airline
#' timetables and schedules API is one of Aviation Edgeâ€™s core features. Making
#' it easy for developers to provide their customers with actual airport departure
#' and arrival times through API on their applications or websites. Our function
#' is to gather and maintain the aviation data and format this into workable 
#' flight schedules and airport timetables for the clients so that they can focus
#' on their core business of providing this information to their customers.
#' 
#' \strong{Sources and process}
#' The flight timetables and schedules come directly from the airports and airlines 
#' when available. Another source of data is through our partnerships with other
#' data providers and aviation. The data is aggregated through dedicated software 
#' which connects us with our individual partners.
