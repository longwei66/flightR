    The main Aviation Edge API for Developers
    "Aviation Edge database is divided between static and dynamic data. Static
    data is that what does not frequently change but due to the massive size
    of our database, there are constant updates. Think about airport and 
    airline information. The dynamic data is that what changes more frequently
    or uses our software to turn it into useful tools. Think about flight
    tracking and airport timetables."
