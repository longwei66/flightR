Description: This package contains several functions to interract with several
    platform providing aviation API. For the moment, two platforms are supported :
    aviation-edge and opensky. 
    1) Aviation Edge (AE) covers dynamic data like flight tracker, Airport timetable, airline
    routes, nearby airports, autocomplete as well as more static data such as airports,
    airlines, airplanes, cities, countries, taxes and aircraft types. This package
    requires a valid API key from aviation-edge, which is available for free with
    limitations, premium packages start from 5$ for 30k calls per month.
    See https://aviation-edge.com/developers/ for details.
    "Aviation Edge database is divided between static and dynamic data. Static
    data is that what does not frequently change but due to the massive size
    of our database, there are constant updates. Think about airport and 
    airline information. The dynamic data is that what changes more frequently
    or uses our software to turn it into useful tools. Think about flight
    tracking and airport timetables."
    2 ) OpenSky Networkâ€™s (OSN) live API lets you retrieve live airspace information
    for research and non-commerical purposes (See terms and conditions). Information
    is provided in the form of State Vectors, Airplanes seen by the OpenSky Network
    are associated with flight state information derived from ADS-B and Mode S
    messages. The state of an aircraft is a summary of all tracking information
    (mainly position, velocity, and identity) at a certain point in time.
    These states of aircraft can be retrieved as state vectors in the form
    of a JSON object. Available API are : All State Vectors, Own State Vectors,
    Flights in Time Interval, Flights by Aircraft, Arrivals by Airport, 
    Departures by Airport, Track by Aircraft. See https://opensky-network.org/apidoc/index.html
