\strong{Flight schedules and Timetables API}
The API service provides the flight schedules and timetables of all airports 
and airlines around the world and maintains this for the clients in a central
database, always accessible with the personal API key. The airport and airline
timetables and schedules API is one of Aviation Edgeâ€™s core features. Making
it easy for developers to provide their customers with actual airport departure
and arrival times through API on their applications or websites. Our function
is to gather and maintain the aviation data and format this into workable 
flight schedules and airport timetables for the clients so that they can focus
on their core business of providing this information to their customers.

\strong{Sources and process}
The flight timetables and schedules come directly from the airports and airlines 
when available. Another source of data is through our partnerships with other
data providers and aviation. The data is aggregated through dedicated software 
which connects us with our individual partners.
